### First Post, yeah!

Welcome to my personal blog hosted by Github Pages.

This is a place where I will document random thoughts, jot down ideas for projects as well as document my 3rd year studies in Informatics at [NUST](http://www.nust.na/).

The inspiration for this blog came about as I happened upon a novel (for me, at least!) method of writing and publishing - using Markdown.

While I am still very much an amateur writer, I plan on writing as much as possible all using Markdown.

A next post will summarize some of the elements of Markdown and its uses as an academic tool for school notes and assignments.
